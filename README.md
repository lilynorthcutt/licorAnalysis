# Analysis of Pepper SHU in Response to Stress

> _Understanding the world of spice_

This project is a part of the New Mexico State (NMSU) Chile Pepper Institute's (CPI) research program. 

# About

We are looking at plant porometry, fluorometry, plant yield/maturity, and environmental factor data to gain better insight into the scoville heat unit (SHU) in new mexican chile peppers.The goal is to understand how SHU is affected by: (1) environmental data such as weather and altitude, (2) the plants stress response (taken using LICOR LI600), (3) the quality of yield - fruit weight, color, fruit maturity, yield quantity. Understanding these relationships will better aid farmers and researchers in all of their spicy endeavors, whether it be breeding the worlds hottest pepper, or simply maintaining a constant heat level in their harvest.

# Usage

This project is fairly contained, with minimal setup. However, due to the proprietary nature of the data, the data is not stored on  github. The instructions for NMSU CPI researchers data access is described below.

## Pre-Requisites
The code is entirely based in R, using SQL to query environmental data.

- **Editor Used**: RStudio version 2023.12.1
- **R Version**: R version 4.3.3
